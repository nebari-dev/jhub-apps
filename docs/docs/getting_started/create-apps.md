# Create an App

You can create and deploy apps for multiple frameworks. Here is an example of
how you'd create a panel app using `jhub-apps`:


### Create App Form

Click on the Create App button and fill in form as shown below:

![Create panel app](/img/panel_app_create.png)

Click on the Submit button

![Create app submit button](/img/panel_app_create_submit.png)

It will take you to the created panel app.
