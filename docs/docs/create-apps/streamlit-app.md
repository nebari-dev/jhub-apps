# Streamlit apps

## Environment requirements

Your conda environment (used in JHub Apps Launcher's App creation form) must have the following packages for successful app deployment:

* `jhsingle-native-proxy` >= 0.8.2
* `streamlit`
* Other libraries used in the app

:::note
In some cases, you may need `ipywidgets`
:::

## Example application

To deploy the [Streamlit App][streamlit-app] using JHub Apps, you can use the following code and environment:

<details>
<summary> Code (Python file) </summary>

In a Python file, copy the following lines of code.

```python title="streamlit_app.py"
from collections import namedtuple
import altair as alt
import math
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

"""
# Welcome to Streamlit!

"""

total_points = st.slider("Number of points in spiral", 1, 5000, 2000)
num_turns = st.slider("Number of turns in spiral", 1, 100, 9)

Point = namedtuple("Point", "x y")
data = []

points_per_turn = total_points / num_turns

for curr_point_num in range(total_points):
    curr_turn, i = divmod(curr_point_num, points_per_turn)
    angle = (curr_turn + 1) * 2 * math.pi * i / points_per_turn
    radius = curr_point_num / total_points
    x = radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = radius * math.sin(angle)
    data.append(Point(x, y))

st.altair_chart(
    alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame(data), height=500, width=500)
    .mark_circle(color="#0068c9", opacity=0.5)
    .encode(x="x:Q", y="y:Q")
)
```

You will see an app that displays a spiral of points:

</details>

<details>
<summary> Environment specification </summary>

Use the following spec to create a Conda environment wherever JHub Apps is deployed.
If using Nebari, use this spec to create an environment with [conda-store][conda-store].

```yaml
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - altair
  - jhsingle-native-proxy>=0.8.2
  - pandas
  - streamlit
  - ipykernel
```
</details>
